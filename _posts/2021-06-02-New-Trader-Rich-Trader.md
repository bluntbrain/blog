## Things I lked in this book

1. If you experience high levels of stress during trading, either your position size is too large or you don’t have enough confidence in your system. To reduce stress, lower your positions or do more testing on your system.
2. Only risk 1% of your total trading capital per trade by using stop losses and proper position sizing. Proper position sizing limits the emotional impact of a single trade. Each trade is only one of the next one hundred. If you keep this in mind, it will give you a completely different trading perspective.
3. It’s better to do nothing than to do what is wrong. For whatever you do, you do to yourself. - Buddha
4. Objective traders have a quantified method, system, rules, and principles that they use to trade. They get in a trade based on facts, and where they get out is based on price action. Objective traders have a written trading plan to guide them. 
5. Your losses are the tuition you pay to learn how to trade.
6. You might choose to sit out the first hour because it’s too choppy. Your system might be to buy breakouts after 10 a.m. on your watchlist, or buy off a bounce in support after noon. 
7. You can measure pullbacks by looking at charts for support. Your stock may have support at the 10-day moving average or the 20-day moving average over the last two months. If you can verify that the price found support at the 20-day moving average and then went back up, your system can consist of buying at the 20-day moving average inside a longer uptrend.
8. You must set realistic expectations so you don’t get discouraged easily and quit. 
9. Patience can pay big dividends in life. Patience is not inaction; it’s knowing what you’re looking for and acting at the right time. Whether you’re waiting for the right trade setup or the right person to marry, patience can protect you from irrational emotions and feelings. Wait for what you want, and when it’s there, go get it.
10. Before you make any decision in life, you should ask the question: “What do I have to lose?” This should precede, “What do I have to gain?” If the answer is: I could lose $100, but if I’m right I could gain $500 and my odds of being right are 50%, this is a good risk/reward profile. If it’s reversed, then you have a bad risk/reward scenario and should pass.
11. Always have a reason to get into a trade, and then a reason to get out of one.
